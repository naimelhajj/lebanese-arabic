\*\*Conversation Summary:\*\*



1\. You provided a full HTML page describing “Lesson 15: Lebanese Arabic 101” with header, breadcrumb, main content (video, vocabulary table, phrases, letters section), progress bar, CTAs, related lessons, sidebar, floating CTA, footer, and a script for FAQ toggling.



2\. I first converted your HTML into a version that could be inserted into a WordPress post or page using a Custom HTML block, retaining your styles inline and full structure.



3\. You then asked for the content to be converted into \*\*WordPress Core Gutenberg blocks\*\* rather than pure HTML, so I produced a block‑markup version using WP blocks (group, columns, headings, paragraphs, table, button) and inline styling, plus instructions for usage, responsive tweaks, CSS notes, and suggestions for reuse.



4\. You asked me to summarise this conversation and provide a title for the file in which to save that summary.
