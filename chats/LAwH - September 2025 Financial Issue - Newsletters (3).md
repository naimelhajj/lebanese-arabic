marHaba everyone\!  
I was thinking this week as I was making my Lebanese coffee (ahweh) that I  
have learned many languages, but only in Arabic do we use a very specific  
word just for the ground coffee powder.  
We call it bann (نّب.(In English, you usually say "coffee" for the beans, the  
grounds, and the drink. But in Lebanon, when we speak, we use bann  
specifically for the coffee grounds. Why is this word so special?  
Cultural Decoder: Where did Bann come from?  
Here's a brief history of the word from what I've read.  
It turns out that the Classical Syriac word from which bann (coffee) was  
borrowed originally meant something like barley soaked in water. The  
meaning developed later, around the 14th century, to mean the coffee bean in  
particular. This shift is similar to how the word for coffee, qahwa (قهوة,(  
originally meant wine\! It just shows how essential the ritual of brewing must  
have been to our history.  
And guess what? Because of this essential ingredient, the Arabic word for the  
color brown, bunnī (يّنِّب ,(ُpronounced benneh(نيِّب (in Lebanese, seems to  
be literally derived from the word for bann (coffee) according to some sources.  
Our language is saying that the color is coffee-colored\!

Anyway, whether it means barley or coffee powder, you need to know these  
three words to ask for your perfect cup here:

|  MarHaba\! I'm so excited to share something new I've built for you\! Telling time is one of the trickiest parts of learning Lebanese Arabic. When do you say "w rebe3" (and a quarter) versus "illa rebe3" (minus a quarter)? To make it all easier, I created a brand new free interactive Lebanese Time clock. You can see it in action here:  |

Drag the hands of the clock to any time you want. Instantly get the correct Lebanese Arabic (إلا تلت؟) and transliteration (illa tilit?). It's the perfect tool to practice and finally master telling time. Click the button below to try it out for yourself\!  |
