What we thought about doing to fill the 21 empty hours is the following:  
Fall Sale:

1. We created a “Fall Sale” where we offered a 50$ discount on the 8-lesson prepared package, making it 180$ instead of 230$, and a 125$ discount on the yearly prepared package making it 850$ instead of 975$. That Sale ended on September 10th. And resulted in many of our active students to renew their package early, as well as 1-2 students who were on a break to return, which is good, and there were maybe 2-3 new students.  
2. We sent an email campaign series to our email list announcing the sale, the results of which are in “LAwH \- September 2025 Financial Issue \- Email Campaigns”.  
3. We opened a new instagram account, and posted about the sale  
4. We posted about the sale on our facebook page  
5. We created google ads campaign to drive users to our original landing page at [https://lebanese-arabic.com/lebanese-lessons/](https://lebanese-arabic.com/lebanese-lessons/)

Trial Lesson discount:

1. On September 11th, after the fall sale ended, we started a Trial lesson discount where we give new students a coupon code for the first lesson, which makes their first 55-minute lesson cost 15$.  
2. We updated the /lebanese-lessons/ page to include that info, and created a CTA for it, and updated the pricing section to include it  
3. Created a meta campaign to promote it (detailed in “LAwH \- September 2025 Financial Issue \- Meta for Trial Coupon”).  
4. We’re in the process of adding all the transcripts to all the videos, and optimizing the page for SEO  
5. We are no AB testing 3 different versions of the landing page, to find the one that converts best.  
6. We have a direct-action landing page that we use with the Meta ad campaigns, and are now AB testing audiences  (detailed in “LAwH \- September 2025 Financial Issue \- Meta for Trial Coupon”).  
7. I am AB testing two versions of the page that receives the most organic traffic (about 700 visitors per month) to optimize for most engagement, and most traffic sent to the lebanese-lessons landing page  
8. Seeing that most leads convert after having entered my website through the homepage, I will AB test several versions of the home page, to try to find the version that leads to the most lead conversions.  
9. I will keep testing and refining the meta ads until I reach a version that is stable and brings me consistent leads  
10. I will keep creating infographics and using them to post them on the relevant page on the website, posting them on instagram and facebook, and sending a newsletter about the infographic.  
11. We’re planning to create a new package, in addition to the 8-lesson and the 40-lesson package, which is the 20-lesson package, which would have a 6-month validity period, 6 allowed absences, and would cost 500$, whereas the 8-lesson package costs 230$, and the 40-lesson package costs 975$  
12. I will promote the fact that whoever takes a trial lesson, and ends up buying a package, they will get the 15$ of the trial lesson back when they purchase the package  
13. I’m thinking that my prices might be high, which is the reason why we’ve been having troubles, but I don’t know what to do about that, without having to reduce the prices, and have our current students be mad that they’ve paid more.
