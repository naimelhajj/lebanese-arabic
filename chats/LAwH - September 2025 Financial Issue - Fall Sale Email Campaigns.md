We can set the package start date for early September, so it begins whenever you’re ready to resume after your vacation. Let me know your thoughts on this\!

|  Hi Naim, Thank you for the infos :) and i hope you re doing fine too\! Unfortunately im not on vacation, i am working but these weeks i have to work some extra hours.. Thats why i had to take a break from Arabic classes. The offer is great actually and it makes sense to get it for one year. I have to check my finances and see if i can afford to pay it at once in September.  I will get back to you about it soon. Cheers  Gülşah Gürsoy \[Quoted text hidden\]  |  |

It’s also a great opportunity to benefit from the discount we are currently offering. As I checked, 8:30 PM New York time is 3:30 AM here in Beirut, and unfortunately, we do not operate that late at night. Our last lessons are usually scheduled at 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM Beirut time, and we start at 10:00 AM Beirut time. Perhaps a class before your work could fit your schedule? Say, around 2:00 PM or 3:00 PM Beirut time?  To avoid any misunderstandings, I’d really appreciate it if you could share a few possible time slots in Beirut time, and I’ll do my best to accommodate your availability.

Marhaba Naim,

Apologies for the delay, I just returned from a trip to Lebanon\! I would love to buy the 8-class package. I loved working with Mireille from last time, if she is still available on Fridays at 5pm Beirut time this would work great.

I also viewed the sale for the 8-lesson prepared package, can I purchase this one please?

Shukran,

Serene
