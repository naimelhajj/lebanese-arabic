### Clarity Analysis Log

**Recording ID:** `k1hpz7`
**Converted?** Yes
**Conversion Action:** `Submitted Lead Form`

**Path to Conversion:**
1. `/lebanese-lessons/` (Entry from DuckDuckGo)
2. `.../lessons-inquiry-thank-you-page/` (Conversion)
3. `/lebanese-lessons/` (Post-conversion return for research)
4. `/videos/` (Further exploration)

**Key Behavior Observed:**
*   This user converted first, and then returned to the `/lebanese-lessons/` page to conduct extensive research, clicking on almost every FAQ and pricing link.
*   This "post-conversion exploration" demonstrates a strong need for more information that was not satisfied before they submitted their details.
*   The user was not deterred by a JavaScript error ("openBooking not found") when trying to click a button.

**Does this journey support the "Homepage as Hub" model?** Partially.
**Why?** This user is a "post-conversion explorer." Their journey shows that the conversion page alone does not answer all questions. Their need to return and research heavily *after* converting supports the principle that users require more context and trust-building content than a simple checkout page provides.
