**Recording ID:** `2fieb2`
**Converted?** Yes
**Conversion Action:** `Submitted Lead Form`

**Path to Conversion:**
1. `lebanese-arabic.com` (Homepage - Entry)
2. `/lebanese-lessons-v2/`
3. `.../lessons-inquiry-thank-you-page/` (Conversion)

**Key Behavior Observed:**
*   The user spent a significant amount of time (1 minute, 41 seconds) on the homepage after arriving from Google before clicking to the lessons page.
*   During their time on the homepage, the user was actively resizing the page, suggesting they were reading and engaging with the content.
*   Once on the lessons page, they proceeded to convert without navigating elsewhere.

**Does this journey support the "Homepage as Hub" model?** Partially.
**Why?** Although the user did not return to the homepage mid-funnel, they used it as a substantial information-gathering and trust-building step before proceeding to the conversion page. This supports the concept of the homepage acting as a critical orientation point.
