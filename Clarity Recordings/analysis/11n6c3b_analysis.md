**Recording ID:** `11n6c3b`
**Converted?** Yes
**Conversion Action:** `Submitted Lead Form`

**Path to Conversion:**
1. `lebanese-arabic.com` (Homepage - Entry)
2. `/lebanese-lessons/`
3. `.../lessons-inquiry-thank-you-page/` (Conversion)
4. `/lebanese-lessons/` (Post-conversion return to check prices)

**Key Behavior Observed:**
*   This user followed a fast, linear path: Homepage -> Lessons -> Conversion in under two minutes.
*   After submitting the form, the user navigated back to the `/lebanese-lessons/` page to click "See Prepared Prices." This indicates that pricing information may not have been fully clear or absorbed before they converted.
*   There was no "exploratory" behavior; the user was mission-focused.

**Does this journey support the "Homepage as Hub" model?** No.
**Why?** The homepage served as a standard entry point, not a "hub" to which the user returned to build trust. The conversion path was direct and linear.
