**Recording ID:** `fb61t3`
**Converted?** Yes
**Conversion Action:** `Purchased Trial`

**Path to Conversion:**
1. `lebanese-arabic.com` (Homepage - Entry)
2. `/lebanese-lessons/` (Initial intent shown)
3. **Site Exploration (`/home-v2/`, `/videos/`, `/books/`)**
4. `/lebanese-lessons/` (Return to convert)
5. `/trial-payment-confirmed/` (Conversion)

**Key Behavior Observed:**
*   After showing initial intent on the `/lebanese-lessons/` page, the user did not proceed directly to checkout.
*   Instead, they went on an "exploration journey," visiting several other content-rich pages like `/videos/` and `/books/`.
*   After gathering information and building confidence, they returned to the `/lebanese-lessons/` page to complete the purchase.

**Does this journey support the "Homepage as Hub" model?** Yes.
**Why?** This journey strongly supports the principle of the "Hub" model. The user treated the entire site as an information hub. They needed more context and trust before purchasing, which they gathered by exploring other pages. This demonstrates that a simple, linear funnel is not sufficient for all converting users.
