**Recording ID:** `10us1cn`
**Converted?** Yes
**Conversion Action:** `Submitted Lead Form` (This user later purchased a trial and a full package).

**Path to Conversion (Key Session on Oct 24):**
1. `/lebanese-lessons/` (Referrer)
2. `/lebanese-lessons-v2/` (Entry)
3. `.../lessons-inquiry-thank-you-page/` (Conversion)

**Key Behavior Observed:**
*   This user demonstrates a pattern of **repeat, direct visits**. Over several weeks, they visited the `/lebanese-lessons/` page more than 10 times, showing persistent interest.
*   The converting session was exceptionally long (7+ minutes), with the user pausing and resuming the form filling process. This indicates deep consideration and engagement with the form itself.
*   The user consistently bypassed the homepage, navigating directly to the conversion page on almost every visit.

**Does this journey support the "Homepage as Hub" model?** No.
**Why?** This user's behavior is the opposite of the "Organic Explorer." They are a high-intent, direct-traffic user who did not use the homepage to re-orient or build trust. Their journey was a straight line to the conversion page, repeated over time.
