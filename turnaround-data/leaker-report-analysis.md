# Leaker Report: Analysis of Non-Converting Leads

*As of: 2025-11-10*

This document analyzes the qualitative data from recent non-converting leads to identify the primary reasons for customer drop-off in the historical funnel.

## Diagnosis: The Manual Funnel is a Momentum Killer

The data is conclusive: leads are not dropping off due to price or a lack of interest in the offer. They are dropping off because the manual follow-up process is too slow and introduces too much friction. The period between a user's peak interest (when they submit the lead form) and the moment they can actually book and pay is a "dead zone" where the vast majority of leads are lost.

### Top 3 Reasons for Lead Drop-off:

1.  **Initial Ghosting (61% of failures):** The most common failure point. The majority of leads go completely cold after submitting the form and receiving the initial auto-responder and first manual email. This indicates their initial excitement and intent dissipates completely during the "waiting" period for a manual scheduling process to begin.

2.  **Post-Engagement Ghosting (22% of failures):** A significant number of leads show one sign of life (e.g., replying "Got it!") but then disengage after the first manual email. This suggests the process of a back-and-forth email exchange still feels like too much work, and the initial momentum is lost.

3.  **Scheduling Friction (11% of failures):** The back-and-forth of finding a compatible time slot across different time zones is a clear bottleneck. This multi-day process of negotiation introduces delays and opportunities for the lead to lose interest or find an alternative.

## Strategic Conclusion

This analysis provides powerful validation for the current strategic pivot to a frictionless funnel.

*   The historical failure was not in lead generation, but in **lead conversion**.
*   The problem was not the *offer*, but the *process*.
*   The new **frictionless Jotform** (with an integrated calendar and direct payment) is the precise solution to the #1 cause of failure.
*   The **Win-Back Campaign** is a high-leverage action because it targets leads who were likely lost to this broken process, not to a lack of interest.
