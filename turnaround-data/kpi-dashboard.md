## 1. Core Financial Health (Debt Crisis)

| Metric | Value | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Parent Co. Credit Limit** | $5,000 | **🔴 BREACHED** |
| **Cumulative Loss (Debt)** | ~$6,719 | **🔴 CRITICAL** |
| **Debt Over Limit** | **~$1,719** | **🔥 EXISTENTIAL THREAT** |

**Diagnosis:** The business is not burning runway; it is in a **debt crisis**. It has breached its $5,000 loss coverage agreement with the parent company, Eedama. The immediate and sole priority is to generate net-positive cash flow to close this gap and restore credibility with the parent company before they pull funding entirely.
