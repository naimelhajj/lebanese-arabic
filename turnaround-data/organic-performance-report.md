## 2. Google Analytics (GA4) & Historical Business Data



This data, provided manually, outlines the historical performance of the organic funnel.



### Historical Funnel Context



For the last three years, the primary conversion funnel has been:

1.  User lands on an entry page (primarily the Homepage).

2.  User navigates to `/lebanese-lessons/`.

3.  User submits a lead form, triggering a **`Lead`** event (*always occurring on `/lebanese-lessons/`*).

4.  Following a manual sales process, the user purchases, triggering a **`Purchase`** event (*always occurring off-site via email*).



The `Lead` event was a mandatory step before any `Purchase`.



### Historical Conversion & LTV Data (2-3 Year Period)



| Metric | Value | Notes |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Total Organic Leads** | 323 | Over 3 years. |

| **Homepage (`/`) CVR** | **1.43%** | 17,328 visits -> 248 leads. This is the primary lead source (77% of leads). |

| **/lebanese-lessons/ CVR** | **1.99%** | 1,360 direct visits -> 27 leads. Higher CVR, but much lower volume. |

| **Content Page CVR (e.g., /lesson15/)** | ~0.05% | Informational intent, not transactional. Confirms these are poor direct-conversion tools. |

| **Lead-to-Purchase CVR** | **17%** | Over 2 years. The most critical metric for calculating CAC targets. |

| **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** | **$850** | Over 2 years. This is a very strong LTV. |



### Entry Pages Leading to Lead Form Submissions (GA4 Data)







This data shows which organic entry pages ultimately led to a `Lead` event on `/lebanese-lessons/`.
