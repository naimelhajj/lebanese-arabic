# The Three-Wave Offensive: 20-Day Turnaround Plan

**Objective:** Generate enough revenue to cover the ~$1,719 debt and secure 5 new students by November 30, 2025.
**Methodology:** A sequence of three rapid, data-driven sprints. Each wave informs the next. We do not proceed to the next wave until the previous one is complete.

### **Wave 1: The Win-Back Spearhead (Days 0-7: Nov 10 - Nov 17)**

*   **Audience:** ~67 recent, warm leads who previously dropped off.
*   **Objective:** Generate immediate cash from the highest-probability audience. Validate the frictionless offer and funnel.
*   **Action:** Execute the 3-part email sequence (sent Nov 10, scheduled Nov 12, Nov 17) with the `$10 Trial` offer.
*   **Parallel Task:** Write the "Post-Trial Nurture" email sequence to convert new trial customers into full-package students.

### **Wave 2: The Organic Ambush & Homepage Test (Days 8-15: Nov 18 - Nov 25)**

*   **Audience:** Existing organic traffic to top pages.
*   **Objective:** Apply the learnings from Wave 1 to our free, high-volume traffic channels.
*   **Prerequisite:** Wave 1 must generate at least 2-3 sales to prove the offer is viable.
*   **Action 1 (The Ambush):** Implement a "Hook -> Hub -> Checkout" model. A banner/module with the $15 offer will be placed on high-traffic pages (the "Hook"). This module will link to `home-v2` (the "Hub") to provide social proof and context. The main CTA on `home-v2` will then link to `/lebanese-lessons/` for the final transaction (the "Checkout").
*   **Action 2 (The Homepage Test):** Launch an A/B test: `current homepage` vs. the new `home-v2` variant. The only goal is to measure which page drives more clicks to the trial offer.
*   **Status:** Asset Ready. The `home-v2` page is complete, QA'd, and performance-optimized as of Nov 10. It is ready for deployment.

### **Wave 3: The Cold Lead Offensive (Days 16-20: Nov 26 - Nov 30)**

*   **Audience:** 90+ day cold leads.
*   **Objective:** A final revenue push before the end-of-month deadline, targeting the lowest-probability (but largest) audience.
*   **Action:** Deploy either the **"Cold Lead Reactivation"** email or the **"Value-First"** (infographic) email campaign. The choice of which to use will be informed by the results of Waves 1 & 2.
*   **Sequencing:** This wave is last because it is the most difficult. We must exhaust our higher-probability segments first.
*   **Note:** Per executive decision, Wave 3 will be launched in parallel with Wave 1 to maximize outreach before the end-of-month deadline. Audiences are to be kept strictly separate.
