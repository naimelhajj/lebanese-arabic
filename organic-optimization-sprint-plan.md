# Strategic Action Plan: 7-Day Organic Optimization Sprint

**Primary Goal:** To definitively identify the highest-revenue organic conversion funnel and significantly expand the content asset base that fuels it.

### Phase 1: Funnel Preparation (Complete this first)

These actions must be completed before the main experiment can begin.

1.  **Create the "v4" Challenger Page:** Duplicate your existing `/lebanese-lessons-v2/` page to create a new page, `/lebanese-lessons-v4/`. On this new "v4" page, replace the lead-capture form with the direct booking and payment form.
2.  **Manually Optimize for Speed:** Since these pages are excluded from your automated optimization tools, you must manually ensure that both `/lebanese-lessons-v2/` and the new `/lebanese-lessons-v4/` are optimized for the fastest possible page load speed.

### Phase 2: Launch the Primary Experiment

This is the most important test for the business right now.

1.  **Configure the Split Test:** Set up a "Split URL Test" on your main `/lebanese-lessons/` URL. Configure it to send 50% of visitors to `/lebanese-lessons-v2/` and the other 50% to `/lebanese-lessons-v4/`.
2.  **Begin Manual Revenue Tracking:** Starting immediately, you will manually track the performance of both paths for the next 14 days. The *only* success metric is **Total Revenue Generated**.
    *   For the `v2` path, track revenue from leads who go on to buy a package.
    *   For the `v4` path, track revenue from direct $15 trial purchases.

### Phase 3: Content & Optimization Sprint (Your main focus for the week)

These actions are to be performed in parallel with the live experiment.

1.  **Finalize the `/lesson15/` Test:** Immediately declare `lesson15-v2` the winner of its A/B test. Make this winning version the permanent page for all visitors to `/lesson15/`.
2.  **Execute High-ROI Content Generation (Top Priority):** Dedicate the majority of your work hours this week to transcribing and publishing **25 new video posts** from your backlog. This is your most productive client acquisition activity.
3.  **Roll Out Winning Templates (Secondary Priority):** After creating new content, apply the successful design elements from `lesson15-v2` to your other existing video transcript pages to improve their performance.

### Phase 4: Contingency Preparation (Background Task)

This is a low-priority task to be worked on only if time permits after completing the higher-priority items above.

1.  **Storyboard a New Ad Creative:** Begin outlining or storyboarding a new ad creative that is based on your existing testimonial videos.
