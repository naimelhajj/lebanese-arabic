# Overall Search Performance Comparison

This report compares the overall search performance of the website for two periods:

*   **Current Period:** February 1, 2025 - November 7, 2025
*   **Previous Period:** April 28, 2024 - January 31, 2025

## Findings

| Metric      | Previous Period | Current Period | Change      |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Clicks      | 45,220          | 40,112         | -11.29%     |
| Impressions | 1,636,574       | 2,765,301      | +68.97%     |
| CTR         | 2.76%           | 1.45%          | -47.46%     |
| Position    | 14.98           | 11.67          | +22.09%     |

## Analysis

The data shows a significant shift in search performance between the two periods.

While the website's visibility has improved significantly since February 2025—as shown by the **69% increase in impressions** and a better average **ranking position**—the total number of **clicks has decreased by over 11%**.

The primary reason for this is the nearly **48% drop in the click-through rate (CTR)**. This means that even though more people are seeing your website in search results, a smaller percentage of them are actually clicking on it.

This pattern suggests that while your SEO efforts are making your site more visible, the search result snippets (titles and meta descriptions) may not be as compelling to users as they once were, or that you are ranking for less relevant keywords.
