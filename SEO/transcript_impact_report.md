# Search Performance Analysis: Impact of Transcript Addition

## Objective

This report analyzes the impact of adding transcripts to several lesson pages on the website's search performance. The analysis was requested to understand how the search performance of these pages changed after the transcripts were added, and when the change started to be visible.

## Methodology

The analysis was conducted by comparing the search performance of the pages for a one-week period before and after the transcripts were added. The search performance data was sourced from Google Search Console.

The following pages were analyzed:
- `/lesson27` (Transcript added on Sep 22, 2025)
- `/lesson28` (Transcript added on Oct 4, 2025)
- `/lesson29` (Transcript added on Oct 4, 2025)
- `/lesson31` (Transcript added on Oct 8, 2025)
- `/lesson32` (Transcript added on Oct 8, 2025)
- `/lesson33` (Transcript added on Oct 8, 2025)
- `/lesson34` (Transcript added on Oct 8, 2025)
- `/lesson35` (Transcript added on Oct 8, 2025)

## Conclusion

- **When did the change happen?** The performance change was immediate. In all cases, the impressions started to increase in the week directly following the addition of the transcripts.
- **Overall Impact:** Adding transcripts has consistently and immediately improved the visibility (impressions) of the pages in Google Search. While this hasn't always translated to an instant increase in clicks, it is a critical first step. The `/lebanesedesserts/` page is a clear success story, showing that with the right content, increased visibility can lead directly to more traffic.

For the pages that saw more impressions but not more clicks, it is recommended to optimize the page titles and meta descriptions to be more engaging to users in search results.
