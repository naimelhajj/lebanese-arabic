1. I will keep looking at clarity once the results start coming in, and I will keep you updated

My top pages receiving clicks according to gsc reports of the last 3 months are:
| Top pages | Clicks | Impressions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| https://lebanese-arabic.com/lesson15/ | 2,290 | 146,585 |
| https://lebanese-arabic.com/ | 1,193 | 26,004 |
| https://lebanese-arabic.com/lesson1/ | 940 | 121,170 |
| https://lebanese-arabic.com/lebanese-love-phrases/ | 707 | 57,561 |

and I see from ga4, and clarity (even though the results are imcomplete because of denied tracking consent), that visitors who start from my homepage are the ones that convert the most.

I also know that I'm doing well in SEO, and on google especially because of the content of my posts. On my posts, like lesson15/ and lebanese-love-phrases/ and so on, I have embedded the youtube videos that we used to make years ago, and little by little, I've been transcribing and adding the transcripts of these videos on the post pages, and these have resulted in the clicks you see above. The posts that don't have the transcript and only have the video, get barely any clicks or impressions. for example before I added the transcript of lesson15, my top post was lebanese-love-phrases/ which was getting the same ~700 click per 3 months. Then I added the transcript of lesson15 , and after a month or so, it was already leading. Now not all videos, and transcripts, would have that result, because it depends on the topics, but keep in mind that out of about 100 videos I have, only half are added with their transcripts on the website, and about 10 of which were added in the last 2 weeks when the crisis started, and are just starting to be discovered.

I don't know if I should be spending time on adding the transcripts or not, because it takes time, and I can only transcribe, add the transcript, format, and optimize about 5 posts per day.

3. I think it's a good idea to brainstorm a new creative and create one in the meantime. That way we can add them to the ad sets anyway, and have meta maybe do its work, because I'm not very confident in the current one, even though it might be good. Our problem here is that we won't be able to shoot with hiba or with the teachers, but that means we can utilize our testimonial videos whose transcripts we have in the "testimonials" folder here.
