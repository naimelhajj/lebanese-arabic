This is not a spearhead. This is a cluttered, unfocused, and strategically unsound landing page that
   violates the core principles of our agreed-upon plan. It is a critical failure of execution.

  Assessment:

   1. The Offer is Buried (UIDs 1_23, 1_25): The primary headline (<h1>) is "Learn Lebanese Your
      Way...". Our "Risk-Free" offer is relegated to a secondary headline (<h2>). This is an immediate
      failure. The user's first glance does not communicate the core message.
   2. The Action is Buried (UID 1_115): The booking form, which is the single most important element on
       this page, is located far below a wall of text, pricing tables, and feature lists. You are
      asking a user who is ready to buy to go on a scrolling expedition. The drop-off rate will be
      catastrophic.
   3. Paralysis by Analysis: The page presents the user with at least five different calls-to-action
      (CTAs) and two different learning "paths" with complex pricing tables. This is the antithesis of
      a focused conversion funnel. It creates confusion and hesitation, which are the enemies of
      conversion.

  This page attempts to be a homepage, a pricing page, and a conversion tool all at once. It will fail
  at all three. We are not building a brochure; we are building a weapon designed for a single purpose:
   to generate cash now.

  The Directive is Clear: Radical Simplification.

  We will rebuild this page. Now. The new structure is not negotiable.

   1. Section 1: The Offer. The "Risk-Free" message is the ONLY headline.
   2. Section 2: The Action. The booking form comes immediately after the offer.
   3. Section 3: The Justification. Social proof and FAQs are placed below the booking form to support,
       not obstruct, the conversion path.
