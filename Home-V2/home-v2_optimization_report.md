**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Objective:** Optimize `/home-v2/` to convert organic search traffic to `/lebanese-lessons/` trial bookings while preserving exploration pathways

---

## Current State Analysis

Based on the limited extraction and your strategic documents (`home-v2_cro_seo_report.md`), here's what I can determine:

### Problems Identified

1. **Page Title Issue**: "home-v2" is not SEO-optimized for your top queries
2. **CTA Confusion**: Multiple A/B tests showing "Many CTAs vs 1 CTA block" - suggests cluttered conversion paths
3. **No Clear H1**: Missing or unclear H1 that aligns with "learn lebanese arabic" (your #1 query)
4. **Intent Routing Missing**: No clear pathway system for different visitor types

### Your Top Queries Analysis

| Query | Clicks | Intent Type | What They Need |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| "learn lebanese arabic" | 230 | **Discovery/Exploration** | Understanding what the learning looks like, free samples, then gentle push to trial |
| "lebanese arabic lessons" | 72 | **High Intent/Purchase** | Direct path to booking, pricing, trial offer |
| "learn lebanese" | 42 | **Discovery** | Overview, free resources, what makes it different |
| "how to learn lebanese arabic" | 35 | **Research/Method** | Process explanation, teaching approach, then trial offer |
| "learning lebanese arabic" | 26 | **Discovery** | Similar to "learn" - exploration mode |
| "lebanese arabic course" | 22 | **High Intent/Structure** | Curriculum, pricing, packages, booking |

**Key Insight**: ~65% of your top traffic is in **discovery/exploration mode**, not ready to buy. They need nurturing, not hard selling.

## Recommended `/home-v2/` Structure

Based on your `home-v2_cro_seo_report.md` and organic traffic patterns:

### 1. **Hero Section** (Two-Lane Intent Router)

```
H1: "Learn Lebanese Arabic Online with a Native Teacher"

Subheadline: "Beginner foundations or advanced conversation. Start with free lessons—or try a $15 risk-free trial."

[Two equal-prominence CTAs side by side]
├─ PRIMARY: "Explore Free Lessons" → #popular-lessons (scroll)
└─ SECONDARY: "Book $15 Trial" → /lebanese-lessons/

Micro-reassurance text below buttons:
"Trial credited toward packages • 10 years teaching • 500+ learners"
```

**Why this order?**
- 65% of visitors are exploring, not buying - honor that intent FIRST
- "Free lessons" removes all friction for top queries like "learn lebanese arabic"
- Trial offer is present but not pushy
- H1 captures your #1 keyword exactly

### 2. **Proof Snapshot** (Compact, Above Fold)

```
[Three horizontal chips/badges]
├─ "500+ learners worldwide"
├─ "Native Lebanese teacher • 10 years online"
└─ "4.9★ average rating"
```

**Why here?**
- Quick credibility without taking focus
- Supports both exploration and purchase intent

### 3. **Guided Pathways** (Intent Router - 3 Cards)

```
[Three equal cards, side by side]

Card 1: "I'm a Complete Beginner"
- Short text: "Start with the basics—greetings, numbers, and everyday phrases."

- Short text: "Browse 20+ free lessons covering grammar, phrases, and culture."
- Button: "Browse Lessons" → #popular-lessons (scroll)
- Footer link: "Try a $15 trial →"
```

**Why this works?**
- Handles all visitor intents explicitly
- Cards 1 & 2 go to `/lebanese-lessons/` but with anchors for relevance

- Every card has a subtle trial link so high-intent users can skip ahead

### 4. **Popular Free Lessons** (Exploration Preserved)

```
H2: "Start Learning Today (Free)"

[Grid of 6-8 lesson cards]
- Lesson 15 (your traffic driver)
- Lesson 1
- Lebanese Love Phrases
- Telling Time in Lebanese Arabic
- [4 more top lessons]

Each card:
├─ Thumbnail
├─ Title

```

**Why here?**

- 8 Lessons: $230 ($28.75/lesson)

```

**Why include pricing?**

## SEO Optimizations

### Page Title
**Current**: "home-v2"
**Change to**: "Learn Lebanese Arabic Online | Native Teacher | Risk-Free $15 Trial"

### Meta Description
```
"Learn Lebanese Arabic online with a native teacher. Free lessons for beginners and advanced learners. Start exploring or book a $15 risk-free trial—credited toward full packages."
```

### H1
```
"Learn Lebanese Arabic Online with a Native Teacher"
```

**Why?** Captures your #1 query ("learn lebanese arabic") exactly at position 1.9.

### URL Structure
- Keep `/home-v2/` for now (A/B test URL)
- Eventually roll winner to root `/` homepage

---

## What to REMOVE/FIX

### ❌ Remove or Consolidate

1. **Multiple conflicting CTAs**: Your A/B test shows "Many CTAs vs 1 CTA" - the "many" version is likely hurting you
   - **Fix**: Use the 2-lane hero approach (Explore vs Trial) then consistent "Book $15 Trial" throughout

2. **Unclear page title**: "home-v2" does nothing for SEO
   - **Fix**: Use the optimized title above

3. **Pushy trial messaging before exploration**: If your current page leads with booking/payment, it's alienating 65% of your traffic
   - **Fix**: Lead with free lessons, THEN funnel to trial

4. **Inconsistent CTA labels**: Avoid mixing "Lessons / Online Classes / Online Lessons / Book Now / Reserve Spot"
   - **Fix**: Standardize on:
     - "Explore Free Lessons" (exploration)
     - "Book $15 Trial" (conversion)
     - "Try a $15 risk-free trial" (inline micro-links)

### ✅ Keep

1. **Risk-free messaging** - It's proven and converts
2. **$15 trial offer** - Clear, low barrier
3. **Free lesson content** - Your organic traffic gold mine
4. **Native teacher positioning** - Key differentiator
5. **Social proof** - Testimonials and stats

## A/B Test Hypothesis

**Control (Current)**: Whatever `/home-v2/` currently shows
**Variant (New)**: Structure outlined above

**Hypothesis**: "By leading with exploration intent (free lessons first) and providing clear pathways for different visitor types, we will increase trial bookings from organic search traffic by 25%+ without sacrificing inquiry form submissions."

**Success Metrics**:
1. Trial bookings from `/home-v2/` visitors (primary)
2. Click-through rate to `/lebanese-lessons/` (secondary)
3. Inquiry form submissions (must maintain or improve)
4. Bounce rate (should decrease)

**Tracking**: Use `data-analytics` attributes on all CTAs:
- `data-analytics="home_hero_explore"` (free lessons CTA)
- `data-analytics="home_hero_trial"` (trial CTA)
- `data-analytics="home_pathway_beginner"` (pathway card 1)
- `data-analytics="home_pathway_conversation"` (pathway card 2)
- `data-analytics="home_pathway_explore"` (pathway card 3)
- `data-analytics="home_lesson_card_trial_link"` (micro-links in lesson cards)
- `data-analytics="home_how_it_works_trial"` (how it works CTA)
- `data-analytics="home_pricing_cta"` (pricing section CTA)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical SEO/Structure (Do First)
1. Fix page title and H1
2. Reorganize hero to two-lane approach (Explore + Trial)
3. Add intent router (3 cards)
4. Consolidate CTAs to standardized labels

### Phase 2: Content Optimization
5. Add "Popular Free Lessons" section with Lesson 15 prominent
6. Add "How It Works" 3-step section
7. Add condensed pricing snapshot

### Phase 3: Polish
8. Add testimonial section
9. Add safety net final CTA
10. Optimize mobile responsive layout

---

## Key Strategic Points

1. **Respect the 65%**: Most of your traffic is exploring, not buying. Serve them first.

2. **Gradual intent escalation**: Free lessons → See how it works → Low-risk trial → Full packages

3. **Multiple conversion paths**: Don't force everyone through the trial funnel. Some want to inquire, explore, or just consume free content (which builds brand authority).

4. **Trust before transaction**: Social proof, transparency, and value demonstration BEFORE hard CTA push.

5. **Consistent exit ramps**: Every section should have a subtle path to `/lebanese-lessons/` for high-intent users who converted during exploration.

---

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this structure
2. Gather assets (lesson thumbnails, testimonial photos, pricing details)
3. Build HTML variant with proper tracking attributes
4. Deploy A/B test comparing current `/home-v2/` vs. new structure
5. Monitor for 14 days minimum (align with current Surgical Strike test timeline)
6. Analyze results and roll out winner
